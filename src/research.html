                    The field of motor control is sometimes referred to as "movement science". That very wording underlines
                    a general state of affairs: when one asks <em>how does the brain controls the body?</em> what
                    they really ask is <em>how does the brain make the body move?</em> In reality, there are many situations where
                    the brain decides to control the body not by initiating movement, but by controlling the biomechanical
                    properties of the body. In fact, biomechanical properties can sometimes be controlled in complete
                    independence from trajectory itself (e.g.

                    I am currently working
                    on untangling how control of body stiffness, or rigidity, relates to control of movement, and how
                    stiffness is centrally regulated to enable stable, yet flexible control of the body.

                  Modulation of the motor control system by rewarding feedback

                    Providing rewarding feedback (money, food, etc..) is a reliable mean of improving someone's motor
                    performance. In fact, there is nothing particularly surprising about the idea that rewarding
                    (for instance, paying) someone to do well will actually make that person do well. However, how
                    exactly does the motor control system allow for this rather mundane phenomenon to happen is not
                    particularly clear. In a series of studies, I systematically dissect the motor system
                    to outline which functional components show modulation by rewarding feedback and those that don't.

                    While rewarding feedback can improve motor control, it can also improve acquisition of new motor
                    memories, a process often referred to as motor learning. But like for motor control, motor learning
                    relies on different contributing mechanisms to produce the behavioural improvements we observe and
                    quantify. While initially it was hypothesised that reinforcement could improve motor adaptation,
                    a subset of motor learning that recalibrates sensorimotor mapping, we show that reinforcement
                    acts instead at another level, often called "explicit control".
                    That is, reinforcement biases participants' voluntary strategy toward more rewarded actions,
                    which is reminiscent of decision-making.
                    We also show that participants' capacity to capitalize on such reinforcement feedback to improve their
                    performance is tied to their working memory capacity rather than their dopaminergic genetic profile
                    directly.

                    A reccurent hope about motor learning through reinforcement has been to enhance sports coaching
                    and motor rehabilitation procedures for clinical populations. The real potential for these applications
                    is directly tied to how exactly reinforcement acts on the motor learning system, as different answers
                    beset different prospects regarding their viability and means of achievement. You can find some
